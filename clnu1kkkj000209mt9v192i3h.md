A zero-day attack is a cyberattack that exploits a software vulnerability that is previously unknown to the vendor. This means that there is no patch or mitigation available at the time of the attack, making it very difficult to defend against.

**How does a zero-day attack work?**

Attackers discover zero-day vulnerabilities by carefully studying software code and looking for weaknesses. Once they have found a vulnerability, they develop an exploit that can be used to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to a victim's computer or network.

**What are the dangers of zero-day attacks?**

Zero-day attacks can be extremely dangerous because they can be used to steal sensitive data, disrupt critical infrastructure, or even take control of entire systems. For example, a zero-day attack could be used to steal credit card numbers from a retail website, shut down a power grid, or launch a ransomware attack against a hospital.

**How can you protect yourself from zero-day attacks?**

There are a few things you can do to protect yourself from zero-day attacks:

* Keep your software up to date. Software vendors regularly release security patches to fix known vulnerabilities.
    
* Be careful about what attachments you open and what links you click on. Phishing emails are a common way for attackers to deliver malware that can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.
    
* Use a security solution that includes zero-day protection. Zero-day protection can help to detect and block attacks that exploit unknown vulnerabilities.
    

**Quiz:** What is a zero-day attack?

* B. A cyberattack that uses a known software vulnerability to exploit a system.
    
* C. A cyberattack that targets critical infrastructure.
    
* D. All of the above.
