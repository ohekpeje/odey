**What is a web application attack?**

A web application attack is an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in a web application to gain unauthorized access to data or systems, disrupt operations, or steal information. Web applications are often targeted by attackers because they are widely accessible and can contain sensitive data.

**What are the most common types of web application attacks?**

Some of the most common types of web application attacks include:

* **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** XSS attacks inject malicious code into a web application that can then be executed by other users. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or even take control of their accounts.
    
* **SQL injection:** SQL injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in database queries to insert malicious SQL code. This can be used to steal data from the database or even modify or delete data.
    
* **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF):** CSRF attacks trick users into performing actions that they would not normally perform, such as transferring money or changing their passwords. This is done by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the web application.
    
* **File inclusion:** File inclusion attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to include arbitrary files on the server. This can be used to execute malicious code or steal sensitive files.
    
* **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** DoS attacks attempt to overwhelm a web application with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    

**How to protect yourself from web application attacks**

There are a number of things that organizations can do to protect themselves from web application attacks, such as:

* **Keep software up to date:** Software vendors regularly release security patches to fix known vulnerabilities.
    
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help to protect against common web application attacks by filtering malicious traffic.
    
* **Implement security controls:** Security controls such as input validation and output encoding can help to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.
    
* **Educate users:** Users should be educated about web application attacks and how to avoid them.
