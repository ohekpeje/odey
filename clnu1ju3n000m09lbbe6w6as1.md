A zero-day attack is a cyberattack that exploits a software vulnerability that is previously unknown to the vendor. This means that there is no patch or mitigation available at the time of the attack, making it very difficult to defend against.

**What are some of the newly discovered zero-day attacks?**

Here is a list of some of the newly discovered zero-day attacks that have been reported in the past few months:

* **Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability:** This vulnerability can be exploited to allow attackers to remotely execute code on a victim's computer.
    
* **Google Chrome zero-day vulnerability:** This vulnerability can be exploited to allow attackers to escape from the Chrome sandbox and gain access to the underlying system.
    
* **Apple iOS zero-day vulnerability:** This vulnerability can be exploited to allow attackers to jailbreak iPhones and iPads.
    
* **Atlassian Confluence zero-day vulnerability:** This vulnerability can be exploited to allow attackers to remotely execute code on Confluence servers.
    

**What can you do to protect yourself from zero-day attacks?**

There are a few things you can do to protect yourself from zero-day attacks:

* Keep your software up to date. Software vendors regularly release security patches to fix known vulnerabilities.
    
* Be careful about what attachments you open and what links you click on. Phishing emails are a common way for attackers to deliver malware that can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.
    
* Use a security solution that includes zero-day protection. Zero-day protection can help to detect and block attacks that exploit unknown vulnerabilities.
    

**How can you stay informed about the latest zero-day attacks?**

You can stay informed about the latest zero-day attacks by following security news websites and blogs, such as Bleeping Computer and The Daily Swig. You can also sign up for security alerts from organizations such as the US Department of Homeland Security.
