Cybersecurity Awareness Month (CAM) is an annual campaign designed to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and to educate the public on how to protect themselves from cyber threats. CAM was launched in 2003 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the National Cyber Security Alliance, and it has since grown into a global initiative.

CAM is a great opportunity to learn more about cybersecurity and to take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones. Here are a few tips:

* **Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible.** Strong passwords are at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. MFA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring you to enter a code from your phone in addition to your password when logging in.
    
* **Be careful about what links you click on and what attachments you open.** Phishing emails are one of the most common ways that cybercriminals attack people. Phishing emails are designed to trick you into entering your personal information or clicking on a malicious link. If you receive an email from an unknown sender or if the email seems suspicious, don't click on any links or open any attachments.
    
* **Keep your software up to date.** Software updates often include security patches that can help protect you from known vulnerabilities. Make sure to install software updates as soon as they are available.
    
* **Be careful about what information you share online.** Don't share too much personal information on social media or on other websites. Cybercriminals can use this information to target you with phishing attacks or other scams.
    

**Here are some additional tips to help you stay safe online:**

* **Use a VPN.** A VPN encrypts your traffic and hides your IP address, making it more difficult for cybercriminals to track you online.
    
* **Be careful about using public Wi-Fi networks.** Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, which means that cybercriminals can easily eavesdrop on your traffic. If you need to use a public Wi-Fi network, make sure to use a VPN to protect your traffic.
    
* **Be aware of the latest cyber threats.** Cybercriminals are constantly developing new ways to attack people. It's important to stay up-to-date on the latest cyber threats so that you can protect yourself.
    

Cybersecurity Awareness Month is a great time to learn more about cybersecurity and to take steps to protect yourself. By following the tips above, you can help reduce your risk of becoming a victim of a cyber attack.
