Cybersecurity is one of the fastest-growing fields in the tech industry. It offers a wide range of opportunities to protect businesses and individuals from online threats. If you're interested in getting started, here's a straightforward guide:

### 1\. **Understand the Basics of Cybersecurity**

Start by learning the fundamentals:

* **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)**: These are the core principles that govern cybersecurity.
    
* **Common Threats**: Familiarize yourself with malware, phishing, ransomware, and social engineering attacks.
    
* **Basic Network Concepts**: Learn how networks function, including key protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP.
    

There are many free resources and courses that cover cybersecurity basics. Start with **free online platforms** like:

* **Coursera, edX, Cybrary etc.**
    

### 2\. **Choose a Path**

Cybersecurity is broad, so you need to choose an area of focus:

* **Network Security**: Securing computer networks from intrusions and attacks.
    
* **Application Security**: Ensuring software applications are free from vulnerabilities.
    
* **Penetration Testing**: Simulating attacks to identify and fix security gaps.
    
* **Incident Response**: Managing and responding to security breaches.
    
* **Cloud Security**: Protecting data and systems in cloud environments.
    

Start with a general understanding of each area, then narrow your focus. To know more about some technical and non-technical roles in cybersecurity, use this [ebook](https://ohekpeje.gumroad.com/l/aqqov) as a guide.
