Malware is malicious software that can damage or disable your computer system, steal your personal information, or take control of your computer. There are many different types of malware, but some of the most common include:

* **Viruses:** Viruses attach themselves to other files and replicate themselves, spreading to other computers on the network.
    
* **Worms:** Worms are similar to viruses, but they can spread without attaching to other files.
    
* **Trojans:** Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software, but once installed, they can perform malicious actions such as stealing data or installing other malware.
    
* **Ransomware:** Ransomware encrypts your files and holds them hostage until you pay a ransom.
    
* **Spyware:** Spyware collects your personal information, such as your browsing history, passwords, and credit card numbers.
    
* **Adware:** Adware displays unwanted advertisements on your computer.
