**Scanning Tools: A Comprehensive List**

Scanning tools are essential for any network administrator or security professional. They can be used to identify hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a network. There are many different scanning tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Here is a comprehensive list of some of the most popular scanning tools:

* **Nmap** - A free and open-source network discovery and security auditing utility.
    
* **Nessus** - A commercial vulnerability scanner that can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities.
    
* **Nexpose** - Another commercial vulnerability scanner that is known for its ease of use.
    
* **Acunetix** - A web application vulnerability scanner that can identify a wide range of web application vulnerabilities.
    
* **OpenVAS** - A free and open-source vulnerability scanner that is known for its flexibility and customization options.
    
* **Wireshark** - A network traffic analyzer that can be used to capture and analyze network traffic.
    

**Which scanning tool should you use?**

The best scanning tool for you will depend on your specific needs. If you are looking for a free and open-source tool, then Nmap or OpenVAS are good options. If you are looking for a commercial vulnerability scanner, then Nessus or Nexpose are good options. If you are looking for a web application vulnerability scanner, then Acunetix is a good option.

**How to use scanning tools**

Scanning tools are typically easy to use. Most scanning tools have a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to scan networks and view the results. However, some scanning tools also have a command-line interface (CLI) that can be used for more advanced tasks.

**Here are a few tips for using scanning tools:**

* Start by scanning your own network. This will help you to identify any vulnerabilities on your own network before they are exploited by attackers.
    
* Use a variety of scanning tools. This will help you to get a more complete picture of your network and to identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by a single scanning tool.
    
* Keep your scanning tools up to date. Scanning tools are constantly being updated with new features and vulnerability signatures. Make sure to keep your scanning tools up to date so that you can detect the latest vulnerabilities.
